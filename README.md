Confetti like particle effects in swift using CAEmitterLayer

CAEmitterLayer is the api of choice to do particle effects in UIKit. Itâ€™s powerful and very often overlooked. A lot of developers use 3rd party libraries to achieve effects that can be easily created using this powerful API.

CAEmitterLayer and CAEmitterCell

UIKit provides 2 classes for us to work with particle effects, CAEmitterLayer and CAEmitterCell. The CAEmitterLayer is the layer that emits, animates and renders the particle system. The CAEmitterCell represents the source of particles and defines the direction and properties of the emitted particles.
